# Polynomial Features Pure Python without Numpy or Scipy or SKLearn: Also added to Machine Learning Module repo

![Polynomial Features Pure Python](https://github.com/ThomIves/PolynomialFeatures/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Module_Polynomial_Tools_Class_Post_Title.png)

This is a new class that is also being added to the [Machine Learning Module Pure Python Repo](https://github.com/ThomIves/MachineLearningModulePurePy). 

This repo contains this polynomial class in isolation (with help from the LinearAlgebraPurePython.py module) and mimics the functionality of sklearn's PolynomialFeatures class.

Our goal is to better understand principles of machine learning tools by exploring how to code them ourselves  without using the **AWESOME** python modules available for machine learning such as numpy, scipy, sklearn, etc.

We hope that such tools **will** provide insights and better understanding into machine learning and AI principles. 

## Deploying / Publishing

I would appreciate it, as you share your work leveraged from this set of scripts, if you would please keep a referral back to my github repo. Thanks! I'd do the same for you. :-)

## Contributing

I am open to share the development and improvements of this with others, but it has been solo up until now. Let me know if you'd like to contribute.
