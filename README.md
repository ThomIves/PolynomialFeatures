# Polynomial Features Pure Python without Numpy or Scipy or SKLearn: Also added to Machine Learning Module repo

![Polynomial Features Pure Python](hhttps://github.com/ThomIves/PolynomialFeatures/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Module_Polynomial_Tools_Class_Post_Title.png)
> This is a new class that is also being added to the ![Machine Learning Module Pure Python Ripo](https://github.com/ThomIves/MachineLearningModulePurePy/blob/master/Machine_Learning_Module_Repo.png). This new class is covered in greater detail in a blog posts from [Integrated Machine Learning & AI Blog](https://integratedmlai.com/pure-python-machine-learning-module-polynomial-tools-class/)

This specific repo covers a polynomial features class that mimics the functionality of sklearn's PolynomialFeatures class.

Our goal is to better understand principles of machine learning tools by exploring how to code them ourselves  without using the **AWESOME** python modules available for machine learning such as numpy, scipy, sklearn, etc.

We hope that such tools **will** provide insights and better understanding into machine learning and AI principles. If you've come here initially, we hope that you will explore the [blog](https://integratedmlai.com) and follow it's posts on using the other repositories.
